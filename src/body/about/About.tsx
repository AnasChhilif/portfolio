                    Hello! I'm Anas Chhilif, a 5th-year Computer Science student at Polytech Nice Sophia. I am currently an apprentice Fullstack Engineer at Stiilt, where I am honing my skills and gaining valuable industry experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am deeply passionate about low-level programming and pure optimization, but my curiosity and drive to learn have led me to explore a wide range of technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the "Yes Theory" YouTube channel, I firmly believe in seeking discomfort as a means of personal and professional growth. This philosophy drives me to constantly challenge myself by exploring unfamiliar technologies and methodologies in every project I undertake. By stepping out of my comfort zone, I ensure that I am always learning and evolving.
